# Vue Auto Router

This program is used to auto genrate a vue router index file

## Usage

Run in the command line

    python vueAR.py your-full-vue-folder-path

Before running the code in command line make sure your vue project structure is good.

    /vue-workspace
        /src
            /views
            /router

## Output

The code will output a fresh index.js in the router folder

Index.js will be standard to the vue documentation

## More Automation To Come

- Make it into a vs extenion and have it auto generate when views are added

- Add different index.js presets to add more customizion 

- Other stuff??
